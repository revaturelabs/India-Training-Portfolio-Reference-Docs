Refer to the documents on this site to generate your portfolio through RevPro. Read through the generic guidelines and then the specific guidelines for your track.

# Generic Guidelines
The guidelines on this page are the same for all training tracks.

* Please DO NOT CLONE your portfolio, unless asked to do so (if you need to make changes, just edit the same portfolio)
* Check your email registered with revature. If your portfolio is rejected, you will receive an email with comments on changes to be made
* Be aware of submission deadlines for Phase 1 and 2

Also, a note on writing. As a developer, you may not think of yourself as a writer. You use GUIs and the command line and code to deliver business value - what does writing a portfolio have to do with that and why is it important? In reality, being a developer requires communicating in many ways, including writing. The code you write must be clear, concise, and understandable to others who you are working with. You have to follow the rules of the programming language you use.

Writing about yourself, your projects, or your skills on your portfolio is similar. [Follow correct grammar and spelling](https://www.grammarly.com/), [capitalize appropriately](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/capitalization-rules/), and make your sentences flow logically together. Be concise - cut out extra fluff just like you would refactor your code to make it simpler and more straightforward. Remember, your portfolio is the first impression that your interviewer will have of you!

### Name & Title
Check that your full name in the top left corner is accurate. Please contact `support@revature.com` if it is not. Select your title based on your particular training track (see tech stack guidelines below).

### About Me
The About Me section should be divided into several sections: 
* Background: 1-2 paragraphs (paragraph should be 3-5 full sentences)
  * Describe yourself, your background, make it unique and personal
  * Should be mostly nontechnical (the rest of the portfolio is about your tech skills) 
  * Can include talking about your educational experience or any prior work experiences (technical, or non-technical)
* Interesting Facts About Myself 
  * This should be in bullet point format
  * 3-5 facts

Your "About Me" section is your chance to stand out to the client. It should be personal, unique, and authentic to who you are. Always keep in mind, though, that everything on your portfolio needs to be **professional**. When talking about yourself, be explicit about your WHY - your motivation, passion, drive, and enthusiasm for what you do.

Where does your WHY come from?  We are all products of our upbringing. The WHY is found by looking back at the experiences we had growing up. Growing up, there were times we naturally thrived and did things well. Those natural abilities manifested themselves in different ways and the key to finding your WHY is to identify those experiences and the patterns across them.

Here are some questions to ponder that can help you express your WHY: 

* What is one verb that describes you well? What adjective(s)? 
* Why did you choose a career in technology? 
* What motivates you to do your work? 
* What are your greatest accomplishments? 
* What do you enjoy the most about software development? 
* What are your career goals? 
* I wake up every day inspired to ____ so that _____ 

A good WHY statement has two parts: To __(contribution)__ so that __(impact)__. (But please don't copy this format directly, come up with your own formulation.)

Finally, here are some examples of what NOT to put in your portfolio:
- Stating that you prefer remote work or that you prefer to work in a particular location
- Information that may be seen as irrelevant or unprofessional
- Details about your personal life or friends or family (use common sense judgement here)
- Don't try to be funny, witty, or use sarcasm (it may be interpreted as unprofessional)
